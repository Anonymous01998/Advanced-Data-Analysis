Project :- Employee Attrition

ABSTRACT
Employee attrition refers to the gradual reduction in employees over time. 
It occurs when employees retire, resign, or are replaced. 
The result of a high attrition rate is that employees are leaving a company faster than they are hired. 
The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset is a fictional dataset generated by IBM data scientists that can be used to compare different factors with attrition.
